# Hangman
Markdown:

This is a Hangman application in simply python code.
The explanation of how it works will be shown in the presentation as well as comments in the code. 

Simply follow the instructions. If it asks for correct spelling, it probably means you need to use a capital letter in the beginning of the input. 

Hangman is a simple game where the program asks you to choose a categroy and a difficulty. 

Once both are chosen the program randomly chooses a word from the specified directory, the user is asked to inout a single letter

the letters build up to the word. If the word is correct, then the program displays how many games you have won or attempted, and offers the user to try again if they wish
If the word is incorrect, the same happens.

If yes, you start from the beginning. If no, a summary and record of attempts and wins are displayed.
